Some feedback:
You should display the full model name in the dropdown box above.

The metadata need to keep track of the Persona setting also not just the persona name.

I want to give them the option to set their own Persona also So like a custom option where they can customize it as like the 6th selection I guess. it will even be better if they can add and delete this custom persona also. and proabably also save it locally. This persona will be for the whole application and not session based.
